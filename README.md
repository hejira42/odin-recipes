# odin-recipes is the first independent assignment in The Odin Project curriculum.

We'll set up a Recipes webpage listing a few recipes, with links to each one. Each recipe will have a list of ingredients followed by a step-by-step description of how to prepare the recipe. 

Each recipe will also contain an image of the prepared recipe.
