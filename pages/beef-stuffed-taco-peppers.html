        <p>Need to sneak in one more veggie on taco night? Swap the tortillas for bell peppers! It's not actually very sneaky in presentation, but they'll taste so good that no one will mind. 
            A beef, corn, and onion filling broils with cheese on top until it's melty, then we finish it off with red enchilada sauce and a sprinkle of onion. We've got you covered!

            <ul>
             <li>rimmed baking sheet</li>
             <li>medium heavy skillet (preferably cast iron)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Preparation:</h2>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Prep onion & peppers</strong></li>
               <p>Preheat broiler with racks in the center and upper third.</p>
               <p>Halve onion; thinly slice. Finely chop 2 tablespoons.</p>
               <p>Halve bell peppers; discard cores and seeds. Rub with oil; sprinkle insides with salt. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Broil on upper oven rack until lightly softened and browned in spots, flipping halfway through cooking time, 5-7 minutes.</p>

              <li><strong>Cook onions & beef</strong></li>
                <p>While peppers broil, heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium heavy skillet over medium-high. Add sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned in spots, 5-7 minutes.

              <li><strong>Finish filling</strong></li>
                <p>Stir in taco seasoning to same skillet. Remove from heat; add half of the enchilada sauce and 2 tablespoons water, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of skillet. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>

              <li><strong>Broil & serve</strong></li>
                <p>Divide filling among peppers and sprinkle with cheese. Broil on center oven rack until cheese is melted, 1-3 minutes (watch closely as broilers vary).</p>
