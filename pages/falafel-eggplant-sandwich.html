    <p>Falafel: As fun to say as it is to eat. We took inspo from sabich - a popular Israeli sandwich - and mashed them together to bring you the best of both worlds. Crisp falafel balls, tender broiled eggplant, juicy tomato and pickled peppers, all drizzled with garlic sauce. Who said vegetarian food is boring? We've got you covered!</p>

         <li>2 oz sour cream</li>
         <li>2 Mediterranean pitas</li>
         <li>.5 lb pkg falafel</li>
         <li>olive oil</li>
         <li>salt & pepper to taste</li>
         <li>garlic</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>What You'll Need:</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Rimmed baking sheet</li>
          <li>medium nonstick skillet</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>

        <ol>

            <li><strong>Broil eggplant</strong></li>

              <p>Preheat broiler with a rack in the upper third. Trim ends from eggplant, cut crosswise into .5-inch rounds. Toss on a rimmed baking sheet with .25 cup oil;
                season with salt and pepper. Spread into an even layer.</p>
              <p>Broil on upper oven rack until browned on the bottom, 10 minutes (watch closely). Flip eggplant, drizzle with oil if dry, and broil until tender, 5-10 minutes more.</p>

            <li><strong>Prep ingredients</strong></li>

              <p>Finely chop 1 teaspoon garlic. Slice tomato crosswise into .25-inch thick rounds. Thinly slice pepperoncini crosswise.</p>
              <p>In a small bowl, stir to combine chopped garlic, all of the sour cream, and 2 tablespoons water, season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>

            <li><strong>Toast pita</strong></li>

              <p>When eggplant is done, lightly brush both sides of pita with oil. Broil directly on upper oven rack until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side (watch closely as broilers vary).</p>
            
            <li><strong>Fry falafel</strong></li>

              <p>Heat .25-inch oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium high. Reshape falafel into 8 (2-inch) patties. When oil is shimmering, add falafel to skillet (it should sizzle vigorously) and cook until browned, 2-3 minutes per side.</p>
        
            <li><strong>Assemble & serve</strong></li>

              <p>Top toasted pita with eggplant, tomatoes, and sliced pepperoncini. Stack falafel on top and drizzle with some of the garlic sauce. Enjoy!</p>
        
            <li><strong>Take it to the next level</strong></li>

              <p>Top off this sandwich with some chopped parsley, a squeeze of lemon, and/or a hit of hummus!</p>
            
        </ol>
