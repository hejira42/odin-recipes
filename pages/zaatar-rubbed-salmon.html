<h2>Preparation:</h2>

<ol>

    <li><strong>Prep ingredients</strong></li>

        <p> Finely chop 1.5 teaspons garlic. Pat salmon dry, then rub all over with oil. Season all over with salt, pepper, and all of the za'atar spice blend, pressing to help seasoning adhere. 
        </p>

    <li><strong>Cook Salmon</strong></li>

        <p>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add salmon, skin-side down; lightly press each filet for 10 seconds. Lower heat to medium; cook until skin is browned and crisp, 4-5 minutes.
        Flip and cook until just medium, about 1 minute more.
        </p>

    <li><strong>Cook couscous</strong></li>

        <p>Meanwhile, heat 1 teaspoon oil in a small pot over medium-high. Add couscous; cook, stirring, until golden-brown, 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon chopped garlic; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add .75 cup water and .5 teaspoon salt; cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low; cook
        until liquid is absorbed and couscous is al dente, 10-12 minutes. Keep covered off heat.
        </p>

    <li><strong>Make vinaigrette</strong></li>

        <p>In a small bowl, whisk to combine remaining chopped garlic, 2 tablespoons oil, and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
        </p>

    <li><strong>Finish & serve</strong></li>

        <p>Add spinach to pot with couscous, then crumble all but one third of the feta over top; stir to slightly wilt spinach. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
        </p>

        <p>Serve za-atar-rubbed salmon over couscous and spinach. Crumble remaining feta and and spoon vinaigrette over top. Enjoy!
        </p>

    <li><strong>Take it to the next level</strong></li>

        <p>Amp up the flavor of the Israeli couscous by adding thinly sliced cucumbers, chopped dill, a splash of lemon juice, or even chopped sun-dried tomatoes!
